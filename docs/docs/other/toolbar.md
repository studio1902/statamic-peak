# Toolbar

Peak adds a hidden toolbar to the bottom right corner of your screen. It becomes visible when you hover it and it displays the current Tailwind CSS breakpoint (when your env is `local`). It also has an edit button when you're logged in. The toolbar can be permantly fixed to your window by toggling the button.
