# Commands

Peak comes with a growing collection of CLI commands to make tedious recurring tasks easier.

## Add Collection
This command creates a new collection and scaffolds out all needed files with some sane default markup containing the various Peak utilities we use.

Run `php please peak:add-collection` to:

* Create a collection in `content/collections/{handle}.yaml` with the variables you defined in the CLI.
* Create a blueprint for collection in `resources/blueprints/collections/pages/{handle}.yaml` containing the page builder fieldset and the SEO tab when your collection has a public route defined.
* Optionally create an index partial in `resources/views/{handle}/index.antlers.html` with default Peak markup.
* Optionally set the index template to the entry you chose to mount the collection on.
* Optionally create a show partial in `resources/views/{handle}/show.antlers.html` with default Peak markup.
* Optionally add permissions to the `editor` role in `resources/users/roles.yaml`.
