# Navigation

Peak includes basic unstyled responsive navigation with two levels. Open `resources/views/navigation/_main.antlers.html` to make changes. There's a desktop version that only shows on `md` screens and up as well as a mobile version that shows on smaller screens. AlpineJS takes care of the interactivity. The state of the mobile navigation toggle is defined on the `<body>` tag in `resources/views/layout.antlers.html`.

Peak also includes an installable breadcrumbs preset.
